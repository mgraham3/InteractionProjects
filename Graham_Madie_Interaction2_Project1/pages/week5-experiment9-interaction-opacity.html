<!--Interaction 2: Project 1: Week 5 Experiment 9: Interaction & Opacity-->
<!--Rational: For opacity, I knew I wanted to user to be able to put themselves into the design, which is a representation of some general emotions that obstruct our ability to change and see clearly. The user can click the faces so they fade, because these feelings cannot be erased from human experience all together, but we can take control of them to be better.-->

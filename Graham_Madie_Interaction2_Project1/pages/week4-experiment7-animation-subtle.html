<!--Interaction 2: Project 1: Week 4 Experiment: Animation & Chaotic-->
<!--Rational: For the subtle animation, I was inspired by those ink exercises used in psychology, where someone is presented with an abstract ink blotch and asked what they see. I think we all see beauty differently, so I wanted to represent that with a textured, ink vector image I made in Illustrator and a subtle fadeIn effect.-->

<!--Interaction 2: Project 1: Week 3 Experiment 6: Sound & Loops-->
<!--Rational: For this experiment, loop to me meant repetition, so I pulled a clip from my favorite childhood film, Peter Pan (2003), which features the repeated line represented through the code with some basic CSS animation. I spent an over an hour trying to figure out how to make my cursor a gif or image (I wanted it to be a ball of light), but to no avail, so I had to change my concept. :D-->
